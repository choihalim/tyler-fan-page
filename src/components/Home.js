      Tyler the Creator
      </h1>
      <h3>Tyler the Creator is someone that truly lives up to his name. Unlike a lot of his counterparts, he is more than just a rapper, he is a singer, songwriter, producer, deisgner, video director, actor and so much more. 
          This was not always the case though and his current status of being a highly intelligent and creative rapper has only fairly recently been achieved. 
          Lets go on a bit of a journey to find out how this wild goofball of an artist went from being an odd yet talented lyriscist to a two time grammy winner for his latest albums.

      <h3>Tyler Gregory Okonma was born on March 6, 1991, in Hawthorne, California, the son of a Nigerian father with Igbo ancestry and an American mother of mixed African-American and white Canadian descent. 
          Unfortunately he never knew or met his father but that gave him a longing and a desire to achieve greatness and fill that void. 
          At the early age of 7 he found the second love of his life and the one thing that would keep him going over the years, music. 
          This led him to start taking CDs from his mom's collection and replace the album art with his own that he had drawn, which funnily enough would become a passion of his later in life. 
          Falling in love with rap at an early age, he listened to big names like: Q-Tip, André 3000, Chad Hugo, Kanye West, Missy Elliot, Busta Rhymes and Hype Williams. 
          This set him on a course to becoming one of the most debatably influential rappers of the 2010s. 
          His love for music deepened at the age of 12 as his grandmother deemed him old enough to listen to more 'mature' music introducing him to artists like: Blackeyed Peas, Outkast, Biggie Smalls and Eminem to name a few. 
          For the next two years Tyler would beg his mother and grandmother for keyboard so he could start learning to play and write music. 
          He did not spend those two years sitting by idly however and this is where the story of Tyler the Creator actually starts; 
          for at 12 he made his first MySpace page dubbed Ace The Creator where he delved deep into the world of creating playlists. 
          At 14 years old he would finally be gifted his precious keyboard, which he then proceeded take to his room, lock the door, and spend the entire summer trying to teach himself to read, write and play music, unsuccessfully so. 
          It would take him several years and many friends to finally be at a point where he could read and write music, this is where his first group Odd Future would come in. 
          The year was 2007 and the most ragtag and uncouth bunch of misfits finally got together along with Tyler and founded the Odd Future collective. 
          It was a bunch of young, crazy, abrasive and talented individuals that felt like they had no place in society, so they decided to make one and in November of 2008 they dropped their first album called: The Odd Future Tape (very creative, we know). 
          Following the zealous hype with which it was accepted Tyler decided to drop his first  complete mixtape on Christmas day in 2009 called "Bastard" (album art here). 
          It was a well received shit show with criticism ranging from "Best mixtape of the Year" to "Obnoxious and revolting but hypnotic, its something that you can't stop listening to". 
          After a brief spell Tyler dropped his single Yonkers (link to music video here), which for a brief moment broke the internet, also landing him the Best New Artist award at the  2011 MTV Video Music Awards, also funnily enough catching the eye of Waka Flocka Flame. 
          In early 2011, Okonma was gaining the interest of a number of figures in the music industry, including Steve Rifkind, Jimmy Iovine, Rick Ross and Jay-Z. 
          Okonma and the rest of Odd Future eventually signed a deal with Red Distribution/Sony in April 2011. 
          His debut studio album, Goblin,(album art here) was released May 10, 2011 and was again a critically acclaimed hit called "the horrorcore album of the year" by most. 
          Odd Future's television show Loiter Squad premiered on Adult Swim on March 25, 2012. The show ran for three seasons and featured guest appearances from celebrities, including Johnny Knoxville, Lil Wayne and Seth Rogen. 
          It was everything from serious family issues to the classic over the top and crazy skits that MTV used to be known for. Wolf (album art here) was released on April 2, 2013, by Odd Future Records and RED Distribution under Sony Music Entertainment. 
          It featured guest appearances by Frank Ocean, Mike G, Domo Genesis, Earl Sweatshirt, Left Brain, Hodgy Beats, Pharrell, Casey Veggies and Erykah Badu. 
          On August 26, 2015, Okonma revealed that he had been banned from visiting the United Kingdom for three to five years, which forced him to cancel a string of tour dates supporting the Cherry Bomb album which had dropped digitally on April 13 earlier that year. 
          The reason for the ban was because of his lyrics in his earlier album Bastard from back in 2009 (that was totally understandable). 
          On April 16th 2017, it was announced Okonma would write, produce, and perform the theme song for scientist Bill Nye's new show, Bill Nye Saves the World. (link to song here). 
          On July 6, 2017, he announced the title, tracklist and release date of his fourth album, Flower Boy, which was released on July 21, 2017. (album art here). 
          This changed everything for Tyler as it was such a huge success and so well received by critics that it got him his second Grammy nomination. 
          This success pushed Okonma to announce his fifth album Igor (album art here) on May 6, 2019 . 
          This album was another critical turning point in Tyler's career as it peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 and even won the award for Best Rap Album at the 62nd Grammy Awards. 
          For his sixth studio album, Call Me If You Get Lost, (album art here) Okonma placed billboards in major cities across the world containing a phone number that when called, played a recorded conversation between Okonma and his mother. 
          That recording is included in the album as "Momma Talk". Soon after the billboards were spotted, a website of the same name was discovered. 
          The album's lead single, "Lumberjack", was released on June 16 and upon release, it received widespread critical acclaim and debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, becoming Okonma's second number-one album in the United States. 
          This success kept going as this album also netted him his Grammy at the 64th Grammy Awards.

      <h3>
          Okonma's music has been variously considered alternative hip hop, bedroom pop, jazz rap, R&B, and neo soul, while his earlier music was considered horrorcore. 
          Over the years, his style of production has progressed from gritty and dark in early projects such as Goblin, but soon transitioned to a more jazz-based approach, with the album Cherry Bomb, which Okonma described in 2018 as his favorite album. 
          Okonma's fourth album, Flower Boy, "marked the beginning of a new era — a complete departure from the wildly offensive lyrics and dark themes that defined his previous works". 
          Igor, Okonma's first Grammy-winning album, was a deeply personal concept album about "the emotional journey of being the odd man out in a love triangle", 
          while Call Me If You Get Lost, his second Grammy-winning album, was a concept album about "the persona of "Tyler Baudelaire," a suave, well-traveled gentleman with a sophisticated taste for high art"
