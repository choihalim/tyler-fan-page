            After a brief spell Tyler dropped his single Yonkers on February 11, 2011, which for a brief moment broke the internet, but landed him the Best New Artist award at the  2011 MTV Video Music Awards.
            This wild and pretty flowering nuts of a video also funnily enough caught the eye of Waka Flocka Flame, whom he later went on to do a track with. (link to music video here)
