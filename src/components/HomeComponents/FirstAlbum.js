                The year was 2007 and the most ragtag and uncouth bunch of misfits finally got together along with Tyler and founded the Odd Future collective. 
                It was a bunch of young, crazy, abrasive and talented individuals that felt like they had no place in society, so they decided to make one and in November of 2008 they dropped their first album called: The Odd Future Tape (very creative, we know). 
                Following the zealous hype with which it was accepted Tyler decided to drop his first  complete mixtape on Christmas day in 2009 called "Bastard" . 
                It was a well received shit show with criticism ranging from "Best mixtape of the Year" to "Obnoxious and revolting but hypnotic, its something that you can't stop listening to".
